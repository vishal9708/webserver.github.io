This is my first project,multithread webserver



COCEPTS:
       We are going to implement version 1.0 of HTTP, as defined in RFC 1945, where separate HTTP requests are sent for each component of the Web page. The server will be able to handle multiple simultaneous service requests in parallel. This means that the Web server is multi-threaded. In the main thread, the server listens to a fixed port. When it receives a TCP connection request, it sets up a TCP connection through another port and services the request in a separate thread. To simplify this programming task, we will develop the code in two stages. In the first stage, you will write a multi-threaded server that simply displays the contents of the HTTP request message that it receives. After this program is running properly, you will add the code required to generate an appropriate response.
